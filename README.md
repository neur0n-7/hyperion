Bot to view scores from Sarpedon scoring servers directly in your Discord server. The idea for this bot is taken from [Daedalus](https://github.com/elysium-suite/daedalus/) (but I didn't know how to use it so I made this :D)

[Add to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1324539169896140901&permissions=1689814080937024&integration_type=0&scope=bot)

Currently a work in progress, doesn't work with **all** Sarpedon scoring servers (well, yet).
