Discord bot to pull and view CSS scores from Sarpedon scoring servers. The idea for this bot is taken from https://github.com/elysium-suite/daedalus/ but is more updated and easy to use.

[Add to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1324539169896140901&permissions=1689814080937024&integration_type=0&scope=bot)

Currently a work in progress, doesn't work with **all** Sarpedon scoring servers (yet).

`pip install -r requirements.txt` to build and then `python3 main.py` to run.
